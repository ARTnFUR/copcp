                <h4>Fires, floods, tornadoes, pandemics - these are the types of events that we often associate with
                    contingency planning.
                    But what if your main supplier suddenly goes bankrupt, your entire sales force comes down with food
                    poisoning, or your website is held to ransom by hackers?
                </h4>
                <p>Contingency planning isn't just about major crises
                    and natural disasters. It can also prepare you for more commonplace problems, such as the loss of
                    data, staff, customers, or business relationships. That's why it's important to make contingency
                    planning a routine part of the way you work.
                    In this article, we explore how to create and maintain robust contingency plans, so that you've
                    always got a backup option when things go wrong.</p>
                <p>Every organization faces a unique set of risks that it needs to plan for. The key to identifying
                    yours is to conduct a thorough risk assessment.
                    The first step is to identify your business-critical operations. These are the key processes and
                    functions without which your organization could not operate - for example, your supply chain, your
                    internet connection, or your ability to comply with legal standards.
                    Next, identify the threats that could harm each critical operation. These could include the loss of
                    key staff, technical failure, or a change in government policy, for example. (Our article, Risk
                    Analysis and Risk Management, covers this process in more detail.)
                    Chances are, you'll end up with a long list of potential threats. It may be unrealistic to attempt
                    contingency planning for all of them, so you need to prioritize.
                    Risk Impact/Probability Charts
                    are a good way to do this. These charts help you to analyze the impact of each risk, and to estimate
                    how likely it is to happen. This reveals which risks require the expense and effort of risk
                    mitigation. Business processes that are essential to your organization's survival, such as
                    maintaining cash flow and market share, are typically at the top of the list.</p>
